abstract = {{myExperiment} (http://www.myexperiment.org) is an online research environment that supports the social sharing of bioinformatics workflows. These workflows are procedures consisting of a series of computational tasks using web services, which may be performed on data from its retrieval, integration and analysis, to the visualization of the results. As a public repository of workflows, {myExperiment} allows anybody to discover those that are relevant to their research, which can then be reused and repurposed to their specific requirements. Conversely, developers can submit their workflows to {myExperiment} and enable them to be shared in a secure manner. Since its release in 2007, {myExperiment} currently has over 3500 registered users and contains more than 1000 workflows. The social aspect to the sharing of these workflows is facilitated by registered users forming virtual communities bound together by a common interest or research project. Contributors of workflows can build their reputation within these communities by receiving feedback and credit from individuals who reuse their work. Further documentation about {myExperiment} including its {REST} web service is available from http://wiki.myexperiment.org. Feedback and requests for support can be sent to bugs@myexperiment.org.}

In order to feed the steady demand for updates on software and associated data, a service infrastructure is required for sharing and providing these tools to heterogeneous computing environments. {RESULTS}: The Debian Med initiative provides ready and coherent software packages for medical informatics and bioinformatics. These packages can be used together in Taverna workflows via the {UseCase} plugin to manage execution on local or remote machines. If such packages are available in cloud computing environments, the underlying hardware and the analysis pipelines can be shared along with the software. {CONCLUSIONS}: Debian Med closes the gap between developers and users. It provides a simple method for offering new releases of software and data resources, thus provisioning a local infrastructure for computational biology. For geographically distributed teams it can ensure they are working on the same versions of tools, in the same conditions. This contributes to the world-wide networking of researchers.}

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of repro-ducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments.}

abstract = {Information integration and workflow technologies for data analysis have always been major fields of investigation in bioinformatics. A range of popular workflow suites are available to support analyses in computational biology. Commercial providers tend to offer prepared applications remote to their clients. However, for most academic environments with local expertise, novel data collection techniques or novel data analysis, it is essential to have all the flexibility of open-source tools and open-source workflow descriptions. Workflows in data-driven science such as computational biology have considerably gained in complexity. New tools or new releases with additional features arrive at an enormous pace, and new reference data or concepts for quality control are emerging. A well-abstracted workflow and the exchange of the same across work groups have an enormous impact on the efficiency of research and the further development of the field. High-throughput sequencing adds to the avalanche of data available in the field; efficient computation and, in particular, parallel execution motivate the transition from traditional scripts and Makefiles to workflows. We here review the extant software development and distribution model with a focus on the role of integration testing and discuss the effect of common workflow language on distributions of open-source scientific software to swiftly and reliably provide the tools demanded for the execution of such formally described workflows. It is contended that, alleviated from technical differences for the execution on local machines, clusters or the cloud, communities also gain the technical means to test workflow-driven interaction across several software packages.}

Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components-a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines-to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281\% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200\%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.}

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ({FAIR}) guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet-lab procedures to computational methods. The {BioCompute} framework (https://w3id.org/biocompute/1.3.0) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the {BioCompute} framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed, and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The {BioCompute} paradigm and the resulting {BioCompute} Objects ({BCOs}) offer that standard and are freely accessible as a {GitHub} organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the "Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development." With high-throughput sequencing ({HTS}) studies communicated using a {BCO}, regulatory agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration [{FDA}]), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next-generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews.}

abstract = {The practice of performing computational processes using workflows has taken hold in the biosciences as the discipline becomes increasingly computational. The {COVID}-19 pandemic has spotlighted the importance of systematic and shared analysis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and its data processing pipelines. This is coupled with a drive in the community towards adopting {FAIR} practices (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) not just for data, but also for workflows, and to improve the reproducibility of processes, both manual and computational. {EOSC}-Life brings together 13 of the Life Science {\textquoteleftESFRI\textquoteright} research infrastructures to create an open, digital and collaborative space for biological and medical research. The project is developing a cloud-based workflow collaboratory to drive implementation of {FAIR} workflows across disciplines and {RI} boundaries, and foster tool- focused collaborations and reuse between communities via the sharing of data analysis workflows. The collaboratory aims to provide a framework for researchers and workflow specialists to use and reuse workflows. As such it is an example of the Canonical Workflow Frameworks for Research ({CWFR}) vision in practice. {EOSC}-Life is made up of established research infrastructures ranging from biobanking and clinical trial management, through to coordinating biomedical imaging and plant phenotyping to multi-omic and systems-based data analysis. The heterogeneity of the disciplines is reflected in the diversity of their data analysis needs and practices and the variety of workflow management systems they use. Many have specialist platforms developed over years. Workflow management systems in common use include Galaxy, Snakemake, and Nextflow, and more specialist, domain-specific systems such as {SCIPION}. To serve the needs of this established and diverse community, {EOSC}-Life has developed {WorkflowHub} as an inclusive workflow registry, agnostic to any Workflow Management System ({WfMS}). {WorkflowHub} aims to incorporate their workflows in partnership with the {WfMS}, to embed the registration of workflows in the community processes, e.g. based on pre-existing workflow repositories. The registry adopts common practices, e.g.use of {GitHub} repositories, and supports integration with the ecosystem of tool packages, assisted by registries (bio.tools, biocontainers), and services for testing and benchmarking workflows ({OpenEBench}, {LifeMonitor}). As an umbrella registry, the Hub makes workflows Findable and Accessible by indexing workflows across workflow management systems and their native repositories, while providing rich standardized metadata. Interoperability and Reusability is supported by standardized descriptions of workflows and packaging of workflow components, developed in close collaboration with the communities. The {WorkflowHub} creates a place for registering and discovering libraries of workflows developed by collaborating teams, with suitable features for versioning, credit, analytics, and import/export needed to support the reuse of workflows, the development of sub-workflows as canonical steps and ultimately the identification of common patterns in the workflows. At the heart of the collaboratory is a Digital Object framework for documenting and exchanging workflows annotated with machine processable metadata produced and consumed by the participating platforms. The Digital Object framework is founded on several needs: Describing a workflow and its steps in a canonical, normalised and {WfMS} independent way: we use the Common Workflow Language ({CWL}), more specifically the Abstract {CWL} (non-executable) description variant to accompany the native workflow definitions. This presents the structure, composed tools and external interface in an interoperable way across workflow languages. {WfMS} can generate abstract {CWL}, already demonstrated for Galaxy, next to the \textquoteleftnative\textquoteright Galaxy workflow description. This language duality is an important retention aspect of reproducibility, as the structure and metadata of the workflow can be accessed independent of its native format as {CWL}, even if that may no longer be executable, capturing the canonical workflow in a {FAIR} format. The co-presence of the native format enables direct reuse in the specific {WfMS}, benefitting from all its features. Metadata about a workflow and its tools using a minimal information model: we use the Bioschemas profiles Computational Tool, Computational Workflow and Formal Parameter which are discipline independent, opinionated conventions for using schema.org annotations. Bioschemas enables us to capture and publish workflow registrations and their metadata as {FAIR} Digital Objects. The {EDAM} Ontology is further used to add bioinformatics-specific metadata, such as strong typing of inputs and outputs, within both Abstract {CWL} and Bioschemas annotations. Organising and packaging the definitions and components of a workflow with their associated objects such as test data: we use a Workflow profile specialisation of {RO}-Crate, a community developed standardised approach for research output packaging with rich metadata. {RO}-Crate provides us the ability to package executable workflows, their components such as example and test data, abstract {CWL}, diagrams and their documentation. This makes workflows more readily re-usable. {RO}-Crate is the base unit of upload and download at the {WorkflowHub}. As {CWFR} Digital Objects of workflows, {RO}-Crates are activation-ready and circulated between the different services for execution and testing. Identifiers for all the components: like {FAIR} Digital Objects, {RO}-Crates can be metadata-rich bags of identifiers and can themselves be assigned permanent identifiers. This enables the full description of a computational analysis, from input data, over tools and workflows, to final results. Using these components we have built an environment that supports the Workflow Life Cycle, from abstract description, through to a specific rendering in a {WfMS} to its execution and the documentation of its run provenance, results and continued testing.}

abstract = {Web-version: https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1 This document specifies a method, known as {RO}-Crate (Research Object Crate), of aggregating and describing research data with associated metadata. {RO}-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, {URI}-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. {RO}-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse. For example: who created it, using which equipment, software and workflows, under what licenses can it be re-used, where was it collected, and/or where is it about. {RO}-Crate uses {JSON}-{LD} to to express this metadata using linked data, describing data resources as well as contextual entities such as people, organizations, software and equipment as a series of linked {JSON}-{LD} objects - using common published vocabularies, chiefly schema.org. The core of {RO}-Crate is a {JSON}-{LD} file, the {RO}-Crate Metadata File, named ro-crate-metadata.json. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the Root Data Entity) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the {RO}-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. While providing the formal specification for {RO}-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.}

abstract = {A Research Object ({RO}) provides a machine-readable mechanism to communicate the diverse set of digital and real-world resources that contribute to an item of research. The aim of an {RO} is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static {PDF}, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. This is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported. Here we propose Research Object Crate (or {RO}-Crate for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a {JSON}-{LD} format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in {GitHub} or Zenodo archives. {RO}-Crate can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage {FAIR} sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.}

We have little empirical insight into what makes a dataset more reusable than others and which of the existing guidelines and frameworks, if any, make a difference. In this paper, we explore potential reuse features through a literature review and present a case study on datasets on {GitHub}, a popular open platform for sharing code and data. We describe a corpus of more than 1.4 million data files, from over 65,000 repositories. Using {GitHub}'s engagement metrics as proxies for dataset reuse, we relate them to reuse features from the literature and devise an initial model, using deep neural networks, to predict a dataset's reusability. This demonstrates the practical gap between principles and actionable insights that allow data publishers and tools designers to implement functionalities that provably facilitate reuse. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the {FAIR} Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a {FAIR} Digital Object ({FDO}) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in {FDO} solutions. We conclude that the {FDO} concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud ({EOSC}).}
