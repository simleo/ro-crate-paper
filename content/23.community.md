### RO-Crate Community

This RO-Crate conceptual model, implementation and best practice guides are situated in a growing RO-Crate community. This community is a key aspect of the effectivenessaffectiveness of RO-Crate for making research artifacts FAIR. Fundamentally, the community provides the overall context of the implementation and model and ensures in the end interoperability. 

The RO-Crate community consists of a:



1. A diverse set of people representing a variety of stakeholders
2. A set of collective norms 
3. A open platform that facilitates communication (GitHub, Google Docs, monthly telcons)


### People

The initial concept of RO-Crate was formed at the first Workshop on Research Objects ([RO2018](https://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/)) at the IEEE eScience conference, which followed up considerations made at a [RDA meeting on Research Data Packaging](https://rd-alliance.org/approaches-research-data-packaging-rda-11th-plenary-bof-meeting) that found similar goals across multiple data packaging efforts [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3250687](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3250687)] of simplicity, structured metadata and the use of JSON-LD.

Discussions at RO2018 identified that while the original Wf4Ever Research Object ontologies [] in principle were sufficient for packaging research artifact with rich descriptions, in practice, due to their reliance on Semantic Web technologies and other ontologies, they were considered inaccessible for regular programmers (e.g. Web developers) and in danger of being incomprehensible for domain scientists. 

DataCrate [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1445817](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1445817)] was presented at RO2018 as a promising lightweight alternative approach, and an agreement was made by a group of volunteers to attempt building “RO Lite” as a combination of DataCrate’s implementation and Research Object’s principles.

This set of volunteers were primarily digital library and semantic web experts. This group has subsequently grown to include domain scientists, developers, publishers, ++. This multiple perspective view has meant that the specification has been able to be used in a variety of domains (e.g…). 

Engagement with other projects EOSC-Life, Bioschemas, etc.

A key set of stakeholders has been developers. The community has made a point of attracting developers that are able to implement the specifications but importantly takes “developer user experience” in mind. Namely, that the specifications are straightforward to implement and thus does not require expertise in technologies that are not widely deployed to implement. 

This notion of catering to “developer user experience” is an example of the set of norms that have developed and now define the community. 


### Norms

We use the notion of norm here instead of principle, these are conventions or notions that are prevalent within the community but not formalized. Here, we distill what we as authors believe are the critical set of norms that have facilitated the development of RO-Crate and contribute to the ability for RO-Crate research packages to be FAIR. This is not to say that there are no other norms within the community or that every one in the community holds these uniformly. Instead, what we emphasize is that these norms are helpful and also shaped by community practice. 



    1. Simplicity
    2. Developer friendliness
    3. Focus on examples and best practice over rigorous specification
    4. Reuse “just enough” Web standards

A core norm of RO-Crate is that of **simplicity**, which sets the scene for how we guide developers to structure metadata with RO-Crate, in that we focus mainly on documenting simple approaches to the most common use cases, for instance authors having an affiliation. This norm of simplicity also influences our take on **developer friendliness**, for instance in that we are using the Web-native JSON format and allowing only a few of JSON-LD’s flexible Linked Data features, and that the RO-Crate documentation is largely built up by **examples** showcasing **best practice**, rather than a rigorous specification that could be harder. In a sense we are allowed this by building on existing **Web standards** that themselves are defined rigorously, which we utilize _“**just enough**”_ in order to benefit from the advantages of Linked Data (e.g. extensions by namespaced vocabularies) without imposing too many developer choices or uncertainties (e.g. having to choose between the many RDF syntaxes). 

RO-Crate is not developed in a vacuum, and while the above norms alone could easily lead to the creation of “yet another” JSON format, we are also keeping the goal of **FAIR interoperability** of the captured metadata, and therefore follow closely FAIR best practices and current developments such as data citations, permanent identifiers, open repositories and recommendations for sharing of research outputs and software.


### Open Platforms

The critical infrastructure that enables the community around the RO-Crate is the use of open development platforms. This might not seem novel but it underpins the importance of open community access to supporting FAIR. Specifically, it is difficult to build and consume FAIR research artifacts without being able to access the specifications, understand how they are developed, potential issues in implementations, and being able to discuss usage to evolve best practices. 

It was seen as more important to document real-life examples and best practice guides than a rigorous specification. At the same time we agreed to be opinionated on the syntactic form to reduce the jungle of implementation choices; we wanted to keep the important aspects of Linked Data to adhere to the FAIR principles and retain the option of combining and extending the structured metadata using existing Semantic Web stack, not just build “yet another” standalone JSON format. 

Further work during 2019 started adapting the DataCrate documentation through a more collaborative and exploratory _RO-Lite_ phase, initially using Google Docs for review and discussion, moving to GitHub as a collaboration space for developing what is now the RO-Crate specification, [maintained as Markdown](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate/) in GitHub Pages and published with Zenodo. 

In addition to the typical Open Source-style development with GitHub issues and pull requests, the RO-Crate Community now has two regular monthly calls, a Slack channel and mailing list for coordinating the project, and many of its participants collaborate on RO-Crate at multiple conferences and coding events such as the ELIXIR BioHackathon. The community is jointly developing the RO-Crate specification and Open Source tools, as well as providing support and considering new use cases. The [RO-Crate Community](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community) is open for anyone to join, to equally participate under a code of conduct, and currently has more than 40 members.
