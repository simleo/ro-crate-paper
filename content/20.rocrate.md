# RO-Crate

As previously stated, RO-Crate provides a lightweight approach to packaging research artifacts with their metadata. What does that mean? Imagine a research paper reporting on the sequence analysis of proteins in an experiment on mice. The sequence analysis experiment code, associated sequence files and reports summarizing statistical measures would all be put in a directory. (Note, this is a brief description of actual practice. See: <https://nf-co.re/chipseq/1.2.1/output> <https://github.com/stain/bco-ro-example-chipseq>

The question then arises as to how the directory with all this material should be packaged in a manner that is accessible and usable by others. By usable we mean not just readable by humans but accessible programmatically. Fundamentally, how can one easily get this data and work with it. A defacto approach to sharing such compilations is through the use of a compressed archived (e.g. a zip file). While this solves the problem of “packaging”, it does imply that the downstream user can _easily_ access the data in a programmatic fashion. This leads to the need for explicit metadata about the contents of this package.

Examples of metadata description abound within the literature both in research data management (?cite) but also within library and information systems (?cite}. However, many of these approaches (discussed in the related work section) require knowledge of metadata schemas, particular annotation systems, the use of obscure or complex software stacks. Indeed, particularly, within research, these requirements have led to the under-adoption and frankly [frustration with current tooling and specifications](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/as-a-researcher-im-a-bit-bloody-fed-up-with-data-management/).

RO-Crate seeks to address this complexity by:

1. being easy to understand and simple conceptually;
2. providing strong opinionated guide to current best practices;
3. adopting software stacks that are widely used on the Web.

These 3 desiderata are what is meant by “lightweight”. We now show how the RO-Crate specification and ecosystem achieves these desiderata.
