With the greater digitization of research processes, there has been a significant call for the wider use of interoperable sharing  of data and its associated metadata. For a comprehensive overview of this literature and recommendations in particular for data, we refer to [@doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100136]. It highlights the wide variety of metadata and documentation that the literature prescribes for enabling the reuse of data. 

Here, instead of surveying the large literature on sharing digital scholarly artifacts, we rather focus on approaches to bundling such artifacts along with their metadata. This notion has a long history [@doi:10.1190/1.1822162] but recent approaches have followed three strands: 1) publishing to centralized repositories; 2) packaging approaches similar to RO-Crate; and 3) and bundling the computational workflow around a scientific experiment.

## Bunding and Packaging Digital Research Artifacts

The challenge of describing computational workflows was one of the main motivations for the early proposal of _Research Objects_[@doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004] as first-class citizens for sharing and publishing, by bundling datasets, workflows, scripts, results along with traditional dissemination materials like journal articles and presentations, forming a single package. Crucially, these resources are not just gathered, but also individually typed, described and related to each-other using semantic vocabularies. As pointed out in [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004] an open-ended _Linked Data_ approach is not sufficient for scholarly communication, as a common data model is also needed in addition to common practices for managing and annotating lifecycle, ownership, versioning and attributions.

Considering the FAIR principles we can say with hindsight that the initial Research Objects approaches were strongly targeting _Interoperability_, with a particular focus on reproducibility with computational workflows and reuse of existing RDF vocabularies. 

The first implementation of Research Objects in 2009 for sharing workflows in myExperiment [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkq429] was based on RDF ontologies [@newman2009], building on Dublin Core, FOAF, SIOC, Creative Commons, OAI-ORE and (later) DBPedia to form myExperiment ontologies for describing social networking, attribution and credit, annotations, aggregation packs, experiments, view statistics, contributions, and workflow components. [@myExperimentOntology2009] 

Programmatic access to Research Objects was facilitated with an RDF endpoint that exposed individual myExperiment resources, also queriable from a SPARQL endpoint, both using the myExperiment vocabularies and RDF formats RDF/XML and Turtle.

## FAIR Digital Objects

FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) [@doi:10.3390/publications8020021] have been proposed as a conceptual framework for making digital resources available in a Digital Objects (DO) architecture that encourage active use of the objects and their metadata. In particular, an FDO has five parts: (i) The FDO _content_, bit sequences stored in an accessible repository, (ii) a _Permanent Identifier_ (PID) such as DOIs that identify the FDO and can resolve these parts, (iii) Associated rich _metadata_, as separate FDOs, (iv) Type definitions, also separate FDOs, (v) Associated _operations_ for the given types. A Digital Object typed as a Collection aggregates other DOs by reference.

As an "[abstract protocol](https://www.dona.net/sites/default/files/2018-11/DOIPv2Spec_1.pdf)", Digital Objects could be implemented in multiple ways. Implementations suggested include [FAIR Digital Object Framework](https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/) based on HTTP and Linked Data, and while there is agreement on using permanent identifiers based on DOI, agreement on how to represent common metadata, core types and collections as FDOs have not yet been reached. We argue that RO-Crate can play an important role for FDOs:

1. By providing a predictable and extensible serialization of structured metadata
2. By formalizing how to aggregate digital objects as a collection (and adding their context)
3. The RO-Crate Metadata File forms a natural Metadata FDO
4. Based on Linked Data and schema.org vocabulary means PIDs already exist for common types and properties.

At the same time it is clear that the goal of FDO is broader than RO-Crate; namely FDOs are active objects with a distributed operations, and add further constraints such as permanent identifiers for every element. While these measures can be said to improve FAIR features of digital objects and are also useful for RO-Crate, they also severely restrict the possible FDO infrastructure that need to be implemented and maintained in order for FDOs to remain available. RO-Crate on the other hand is more flexible, it can minimally be used within any file system structure, or ideally exposed through a range of Web-based scenarios, but a _FAIR profile of RO-Crate_ (e.g. enforcing PID usage) will also fit well within and help to implement a FAIR Digital Object ecosystem.


## Packaging Workflows

The use of computational workflows has gained prominence, in particular life sciences, typically combining a chain of open source tools in an analytical pipeline. While the workflows initially may have been used to improve scalability, it can be argued they both assist in making computated data results FAIR, but at the same time raising additional FAIR challenges when considering the workflows as important research artifacts themselves in order to capture and explain the computational method behind an analysis [@doi:10.1162/dint_a_00033].

Even when researchers follow current best practice for workflow reproducibility, [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.014] [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2017.01.012] the communication of that outcome through traditional academic publishing routes with a textual representation adds barriers that hinder reproducibility and FAIR use of the knowledge previously captured in the workflow. Even as researchers the ambition of FAIR reproducible research, it has not yet become common practice.

As a real-life example let's look at a metagenomics article [@doi:10.1038/s41586-019-0965-1], where the authors have gone to extraordinary effort to document the individual tools that have been reused, including their citations, versions, settings, parameters and combinations. The _Methods_ section is 2 pages in tight double-columns with 24 additional references, supported by data availability on FTP server (60 GB) [@ebi_ftp_umgs2019] and the open source code in GitHub repository [Finn-Lab/MGS-gut](https://github.com/Finn-Lab/MGS-gut) [@finn-lab-mgsgut] includes the pipeline as shell scripts and associated analysis scripts in R and Python.

This attention to reporting detail for computational workflows is unfortunately not yet the norm, and although bioinformatics journals have strong _data availability_ requirements they frequently [do not require](https://twitter.com/soilandreyes/status/1250721245622079488) authors to include or cite _software, scripts and pipelines_ used for analysing and producing results[ [@soilandreyes_tweet_2020] - rather authors are often penalized for doing so [cite?] as it would work against artificial limits on number of pages and references.

However detailed, for a new researcher who wants to reuse a particular computational method they may first want to assess if the described tool and workflow is Re-runnable (executable at all), Repeatable (same results for original inputs on same platform), Reproducible (same results for original inputs with different platform or newer tools) and ultimately Reusable (similar results for different input data), Repurposable (reusing parts of the method for making a new method) or Replicable (rewriting workflow following the method description). [@doi:10.3389/fninf.2017.00069] [@goble_presentation_2016]

Following the textual description alone, researchers would be forced to jump straight to evaluate "Replicable" by rewriting the pipeline from scratch. This can be expensive and error-prone. They would firstly need to install all the software dependencies and reference datasets. This can be a daunting task in itself, which may have to be repeated multiple times as workflows typically are developed at small scale on their desktop computer, scaled up to a local cluster, and potentially productionized using cloud instances, each of which will have different requirements for software installations.

In recent years the situation has been greatly improved by software packaging and container technologies like Docker and Conda, which have seen increased adaptation in life sciences [@doi:10.1007/s41019-017-0050-4] with supporting collaborative efforts like BioConda [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0046-7], BioContainers [??] and by Linux distributions themselves (Debian Med [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-S12-S5] to make more than 7000 software packages available [in BioConda alone] (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/) and 9000 containers [in BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). Docker and Conda has gained integration in workflow systems like Snakemake, Galaxy, Nextflow, meaning a downloaded workflow definition can now be executed on a "blank" machine (except for the workflow engine) with the underlying analytical tools installed on demand.
