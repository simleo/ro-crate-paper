## Bioinformatics workflows

[WorkflowHub.eu](https://workflowhub.eu/) is a European cross-domain registry of computational workflows, supported by European Open Science Cloud projects like [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) and research infrastructures such as the pan-European bioinformatics network [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) [@doi:10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.02.002]. As part of promoting workflows as reusable tools, the WorkflowHub includes documentation and high-level rendering of the workflow structure independent of its native workflow definition format - the rationale is that a domain scientist looking for a particular computational analysis can browse all relevant workflows before narrowing down their workflow engine requirements. As such, the WorkflowHub is intended largely as a registry of workflows already deposited in repositories specific to particular workflow languages and domains, such as UseGalaxy.eu and Nextflow nf-core. 

Being cross-domain also means the WorkflowHub has to cater for many different workflow systems. Many of these, for instance Nextflow and Snakemake, by their script-like nature, reference multiple neighbouring files typically maintained in a GitHub repository. The WorkflowHub [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4605654] has therefore adapted RO-Crate as the packaging mechanism  by typing and annotating the constituent files of a workflow, crucially marking up the workflow language, as many workflow engines use common file extensions like `*.xml` and `*.json`. Workflows are further described with authors, license, diagram previews and a listing of their inputs and outputs. RO-Crates can thus be used for interoperable deposition of workflows to the WorkflowHub, but is also used as an archive for downloading workflows, embedding metadata registered with the WorkflowHub entry and translated workflow definitions such as abstract CWL and diagrams. 

In WorkflowHub, RO-Crate therefore can be seen as taking on the role of an interoperability layer between registries, repositories and users. The iterative development between WorkflowHub developers and RO-Crate community heavily informed the creation of the Bioschemas[@bioschemas_2017] profile for [Computational Workflow](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/1.0-RELEASE/), which again informed the [RO-Crate 1.1 specification on workflows](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/workflows.html) and led to the RO-Crate Python library and WorkflowHubâ€™s [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/), which in a similar fashion to RO-Crate itself recommends which workflow resources and descriptions are required. This co-development across project boundaries exemplifies the drive for simplicity and for establishing best practices.

While RO-Crates in WorkflowHub so far have been focused on workflows that are ready to be run, they are now moving into the development of a _Workflow Run RO-Crate_ profile for the purposes of benchmarking, testing and executing workflows. As such, RO-Crate serves as container of both a workflow definition that may be executed and of a workflow execution and test results. Additionally, WorkflowHub has recently enabled minting of DOIs for registered workflows, e.g. [@doi:10.48546/workflowhub.workflow.56.1], lowering the barrier for citing computational methods along with their FAIR metadata captured as an RO-Crate.
